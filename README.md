## Replay It

* In this prioject you will be able to log in with your spotify account.
* The homepage will display the top played songs on your spotify account.
* You will then be able to create a playlist using this data.
* You can choose the name for the playlist and description

### Stacks used

* This app was made using ReactJS  as a front end app.
* OAuth is used to login in to your existing account
* Using fetch method to GET and POST itemd to users account on spotify

### Future

* Would like to implement the backend side to avoid logging in everytime page is refreshed.
* Would like to add the ability to login with Apple Music as well.
* Implement automatic playlist building with the updated more played tracks along with suggestions. Especially on the Apple Music side. As Spotify already does this well
